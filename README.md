# LiftSpotter 

## Overview


LiftSpotter is a web app that will allow users to keep track of their lifting process. Users can create new lifting routines, record reps and sets, and record weight lifted. In addition, users can upload their routines online for other users to rate and use. 

## Data Model
The application will store Users, Lists and Items

* users can have multiple lists (via references)
* each list can have multiple items (by embedding)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "Chestbrah",
  hash: // a password hash,
  lists: // an array of references to List documents
  
}
```

An Example List with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  name: "5/3/1 Routine",
  Routine: [
    { name: "bench", sets and reps: [3, 8], weight: 225, finished: true},
    { name: "squats", sets and reps: [3, 8], weight: 435, finished: false},
  ],
  createdAt: // timestamp
}
```
